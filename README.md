# Practical Data Science With R Problems
This repo is a collection of problems and recreations based on the "Practical Data Science with R" book by by Nina Zumel and John Mount. The problems are theirs and some of the solutions are laid out in their great book.

This repo is only for practicing and trainnig my R skills, it is not a definitive solution to all problems nor do I take credit for the great content and solutions they put forth.

## Structure
There are two main documents based on the book, both are RMarkdown files. Each one of these files was converted into a Word Document and an html document. This is for readability and personal preference. Also a bit to experiment with R notebooks and their capabilities.
